            Dan White wants learning to be associated with meaning and inspiration rather than accountability and drudgery. Accordingly, he believes that learning should be highly interactive, and that game-based learning, like project- and inquiry-based learning, is a "best practice" in the field of education. An alumnus of Cornell University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Dan has two primary passions: making outstanding learning games and building sustainable businesses.
